# Get API Token

> Home / Get API Token

Follow this guide to generate a new API token and pass it to the Currency Marketplace endpoints.

## Generate an API token

1. Open the [SkyCoach API Keys page](https://skycoach.gg/pro/apiKeys).
2. Click **Generate key** and enter a descriptive name (maximum 50 characters).
3. A token similar to `1fcae87ee5581413b7a1152f495e19a28e9e6427727678d0eb32b32797c41e6c` will be created.

**IMPORTANT: Save the token immediately — it is displayed only once.** Do not share it with third parties; anyone holding the token can control your offers.

If you delete a token on the API Keys page, it is removed permanently and cannot be used again. Create a new token if you need to restore access.

## Call APIs with the token

```
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
```

Example request:

```
GET {BASE_URL}/api/shop/marketplace/products/list
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
Accept: application/json
```
