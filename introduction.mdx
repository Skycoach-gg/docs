# SkyCoach Marketplace API

> ** REST API for automating your marketplace workflows on SkyCoach**

Welcome to SkyCoach Marketplace API — your gateway to programmatically manage products, offers, credentials, and marketplace operations. Our API enables seamless integration of SkyCoach's marketplace functionality into your business tools and automated workflows.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://skycoach.gg/api/shop/marketplace
```

Make sure to include the full path `/api/shop/marketplace` in your API calls.

**Examples:**

```
https://skycoach.gg/api/shop/marketplace/products/list
https://skycoach.gg/api/shop/marketplace/offers/my
```

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with the SkyCoach Marketplace API:

1. **[Get your API token](./get-api-token)** — Generate and securely store your Bearer token
2. **[Authenticate your requests](#authentication)** — Set up Bearer token authentication
3. **[Make your first API call](#core-endpoints)** — Explore our core endpoints
4. **[Handle rate limits](#rate-limiting)** — Implement best practices for rate limit management

## Core Endpoints

The SkyCoach Marketplace API provides comprehensive endpoints for managing your marketplace operations:

- **Products**: Retrieve available products for creating offers
- **Offers**: Create, update, and manage your marketplace offers
- **Credentials**: Handle login credentials for your offers
- **Status Management**: Monitor and control offer statuses

For detailed endpoint documentation, see the [API Reference](https://123-f571222f.mintlify.app/api-reference/).

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens. Learn how to generate and manage your API tokens in our [authentication guide](./get-api-token).

**Example:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     https://skycoach.gg/api/shop/marketplace/products/list
```

## API Responses

The SkyCoach Marketplace API uses consistent JSON response formats across all endpoints. Responses include:

- **Success indicators**: Clear success/failure status
- **Structured data**: Consistent data format for easy parsing
- **Error details**: Comprehensive error messages with context
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 formatted timestamps

See the [API Overview](./marketplace-api-overview.md) for detailed response format documentation.

## Rate Limiting

All API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure service stability and fair usage:

- **Global Limit**: 120 requests per minute
- **Shared Across Endpoints**: All marketplace endpoints share the same rate limit pool
- **Burst Capacity**: Up to 10 requests in the first second
- **Reset Window**: Rolling 60-second window

Rate limit information is included in response headers (`X-RateLimit-*`). See our [Rate Limiting Guide](./marketplace-api-overview.md#rate-limiting) for best practices on handling rate limits effectively, including exponential backoff strategies.
